Description: Secure Cookie and Session library for PHP
 Why:
 .
  * PHP >= 5.4 supported (CentOS 7 default PHP is supported);
  * Replace complicated setcookie() which is not secure by default (HttpOnly,
    Secure, SameSite are not the default);
  * delight-im/cookie and paragonie/cookie, in addition to requiring PHP >= 5.6,
    parse cookies, which is best avoided for security reasons and code
    simplicity;
  * Allow binding PHP sessions to "Domain" and "Path" (see below);
  * Easy to use PHP session API;
  * Uses a "Canary" to regularly refresh session ID;
  * Expires the PHP session on the server;
  * Implements SameSite attribute value;
  * Unit tests with PHPUnit;
