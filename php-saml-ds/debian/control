Description: SAML Discovery Service written in PHP
 The php-saml-ds SAML Discovery Service follows the Identity Provider Discovery
 Service Protocol and Profile (mod_auth_mellon supports this).  It features:
  - Logo support, extracted from (eduGAIN) metadata;
  - Most browsers are supported;
  - JS not required (works perfectly well with JS disabled);
  - Keyboard navigation using TAB to select (next/previous) IdP;
  - Filter (keyword) support, i.e. only show entries that (string) match the
    filter you provide, also without JS.
