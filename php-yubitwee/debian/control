 A very simple, secure YubiKey OTP Validator with pluggable HTTP client.
 The correct thing to be doing is using U2F, so do not use this library if
 you are writing new software, please investigate U2F as that will be more
 secure than using the proprietary YubiCo solution for verifying hardware
 tokens!
