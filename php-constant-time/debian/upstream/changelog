Version 2.2.2 - Mar 10, 2018

    This library now has 100% type-safety.
    Added unit tests to detect string truncation bugs that were (mistakenly?) reported.


Version 2.2.1 - Jan 22, 2018

    Fix a pasto reported by Ed Barnard on Twitter.


Version 2.2.0 - Sep 22, 2017

    Adds encodeUnpadded() to Base32 and Base64 (and their derived classes). Satisfies #9.


Version 2.1.1 - Sep 16, 2017

Fix composer.json typo.


Version 2.1.0 - Sep 16, 2017

Previous tag was a false alarm. This is the real deal.

This library is now type-safe. Encoding functions (e.g. Base64::decode()) will always return a string or throw a RangeException. They will never return false.

Furthermore, type safety is assured with Psalm.


Version 2.0.3 - Jul 11, 2016

Throw a RangeException instead of returning false in a function with a return type of string.


Version 2.0.2 - Jun 13, 2016

Handle an edge-case reported in #4


Version 2.0.1 - May 10, 2016

    Added scalar type declarations to Binary.


Version 2.0.0 - Apr 8, 2016

Version 2 will require PHP 7 and use scalar type declarations.


Version 1.0.1 - Jun 13, 2016

Handle edge-case reported in #4


Version 1.0.0 - Apr 8, 2016

We're now stable (and with sufficient test coverage to be confident about the correctness of our implementation).


Version 0.6.0 - Apr 8, 2016

    Base32: Default to lowercase output, add encodeUpper() and decodeUpper().
    RFC4648: Removed erroneous encodeUpper() references. Base64 is case-sensitive.


Version 0.5.1 - Mar 24, 2016

    Return false instead of throwing a RangeException in Base64::decode()


Version 0.5.0 - Mar 14, 2016

    Add Base64UrlSafe
    Create an RFC4648 class for strict RFC conformity
    Added more unit tests


Version 0.4.0 - Mar 13, 2016

Relaxed the version requirements to accommodate PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4. No other code changes were made.


Version 0.3.0 - Mar 12, 2016

    Added Base32Hex
    Restructured into classes
    We now cover all of the encoding formats specified by RFC 4648


Version 0.2.1 - Mar 12, 2016

    Mitigate chr()/ord() related cache-timing vulnerability.


Version 0.2.0 - Mar 12, 2016

Added Base32 (as specified in RFC 4648).


Version 0.1.0 - Feb 3, 2016

Initial release
