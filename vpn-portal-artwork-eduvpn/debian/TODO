- postinst,postrm: should _we_ deal with clearing cache?  likely this would better
be handled by the application which actually _writes_ to the cache.

- debian/install: couldn't vpn-admin-portal and vpn-user-portal consult something like
/usr/share/vpn-portal-artwork-eduvpn ?  it feels wrong we are writing in
vpn-admin-portal and vpn-user-portal's directories (
/usr/share/{vpn-user-portal,vpn-admin-portal} )

- why are we at https://github.com/eduvpn/vpn-portal-artwork while we're named
  vpn-portal-artwork-eduVPN !?

- debian/copyright: fix this once there's a new upstream which _does_ ship license.
