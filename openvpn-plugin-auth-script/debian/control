Description: OpenVPN plugin to auth connections using non-blocking external script
 Runs an external script to decide whether to authenticate a user or not.
 Useful for checking 2FA on VPN auth attempts as it doesn't block the main
 openvpn process, unlike passing the script to --auth-user-pass-verify flag.
 .
 The idea of the plugin is to do as little as possible, and let the external
 binary do all the heavy lifting itself.
